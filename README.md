Rust Phylogenomics scripts
===========================

This fork contains a quickfix for the main scripts used in the CodeML analyses in the paper Silva et al. (2014) entitled "Genomic patterns of positive
selection at the origin of rust fungi".

Only codeml_parser.py was updated.

Information on the description, configuration and usage of the scripts will be integrated in the dedicated wiki pages.
